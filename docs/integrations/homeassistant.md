# Using Sonos2mqtt with Home Assistant

In Q1 of 2023 I released a special integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) that allows you to use Sonos2mqtt in combination with Home Assistant.

The Sonos2mqtt integration requires at least `3.2.0-beta8` at this moment, be sure to check this page or information on the component for more information.

## Installation

1. Install the [Home Assistant Community Store](https://hacs.xyz/) integration
2. Install the [Sonos2mqtt companion](https://github.com/svrooij/home-assistant-mqtt-component) integration through HACS.
3. There is not step 3, once installed the integration is auto discovered in Home Assistant.

## Issues

This integration has an [issue tracker](https://github.com/svrooij/home-assistant-mqtt-component/issues) if you're experiencing issues with this integration.
